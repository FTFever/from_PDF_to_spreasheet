# from_PDF_to_spreasheet
This is part of the data-cleaning process for my research project on the economic impacts of the Chinese high-speed rail (HSR) network. Due to limited access to clean data, I collected over 500 original PDF files. Initially, I tried different software and Python packages to convert them into Excel/CSV. However, the accuracy depended on the PDF's published year - the older the file, the more errors it contained. Since none of these approaches create error-free results, I adopted a two-step strategy: conversion and cleaning. I chose the most efficient software, AFF, for the conversion process, and then developed algorithms to check and validate the results. These algorithms account for structural variations in tables across different years and are thoroughly documented in this repository.

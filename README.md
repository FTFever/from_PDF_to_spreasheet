# from_PDF_to_spreasheet
This is part of the data-cleaning process for one of my research projects that evaluates the economic impacts of the Chinese high-speed rail (HSR) network. Due to limited access to clean data, I turned to the original PDF files and collected a total number of 500+ PDF files. I tried different software and Python packages to convert these files to Excel/CSV formats at the beginning. While the number of errors that the converted file includes is determined by the initiated year of the PDF file, the older the file is, the more errors the converted file includes, none of these approaches could create error-free results. Realizing the fact that I could not get a clean file at one time, I adopted a two-step strategy: converting and cleaning. I chose the most efficient software, named AFF, for the converting process. Then, I developed algorithms to check and validate the converted results over time since the structure of tables in these PDF files changes by year. These algorithms are documented in this repository in detail.
